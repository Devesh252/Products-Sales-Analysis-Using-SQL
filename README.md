# Products-Sales-Analysis-Using-SQL


## Project Description : 
  Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

  However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data   analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech      and soft skills. Hence, he     decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.


 **Project objective:**
  **1.** Checked ad-hoc-requests for which the business needs insights.
    
  **2.** Performed a SQL query using MySQL to answer these requests.
    
  **3.** Created a reports and export it into csv file so that it can be used for visualisation.


**Resources provided**
    Dataset which includes a comprehensive overview of the tables found in the provided (atliq_hardware_db) database. It includes information for six       main tables:

    dim_customer: contains customer-related data
    dim_product: contains product-related data
    fact_gross_price: contains gross price information for each product
    fact_manufacturing_cost: contains the cost incurred in the production of each product
    fact_pre_invoice_deductions: contains pre-invoice deductions information for each product
    fact_sales_monthly: contains monthly sales data for each product.


**Preparation for reports:**

   **1.** created Fact actual and estimate table for supply chain analysis report.  _[View](https://github.com/Devesh252/Products-Sales-Analysis-Using-SQL/blob/main/creates%20queries/Views.txt)_
   
   **2.** Prepared some views for creating table where we can make the use of view for analysis.  _[table](https://github.com/Devesh252/Products-Sales-Analysis-Using-SQL/blob/main/creates%20queries/actual_estimate_table.txt)_
   
   **3.** Created Stored Procedures where we can call it and reuse the piece of query in different query.  _[Stored Procedure](https://github.com/Devesh252/Products-Sales-Analysis-Using-SQL/blob/main/creates%20queries/Stored%20Procedure.txt)_
   
   **4.** Created some user defined function to get query performance and readability of queries.  _[User Defined Function](https://github.com/Devesh252/Products-Sales-Analysis-Using-SQL/blob/main/creates%20queries/Functions.txt)_
   

**Reports:**

  **1.** Created Gross Sales  report for Croma India.  _[Gross Sales Report](https://github.com/Devesh252/Products-Sales-Analysis-Using-SQL/blob/main/Reports/croma_india_Gross_Sales_Report.csv)_

  **5.** Created report for Region wise Market Shares of Customer.  _[Region Wise Market Shares](https://github.com/Devesh252/Products-Sales-Analysis-Using-SQL/blob/main/Reports/regionWise_market_shares.csv)_ 

  **6.** Created Supply Chain report.  _[Supply Chain Report](https://github.com/Devesh252/Products-Sales-Analysis-Using-SQL/blob/main/Reports/supply_chain_forecast_accuracy_report_2020%262021.csv)_
